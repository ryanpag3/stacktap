# StackTap

## About

StackTap is a fully open-source Magic: The Gathering deck-building and inventory management software for both players and TCG Shops. We are **mobile-first** and plan on supporting iOS and Android with a public API that other developer's can consume. Web and desktop support is planned for a later date.

We are under active development, so please be sure to check back frequently on our progress.

## Why FOSS?

Since its inception, card games have been a community-driven and collaborative experience. We believe that free and open-source software (FOSS) facilitates a model that allows users the freedom to deploy what they want, where they want. We will be providing a hosted version of StackTap available to download from the iOS and Android app stores when we launch. This app will use a freemium model in order to sustain the server costs of running and developing it, but *all features of StackTap will remain free, forever, for self-hosted users.*

## When can I expect this to be released?

Open beta is planned for 2025. While I am eager and excited to release this as quickly as possible, I believe good things take time, and with passion projects there is no rush. It will be ready when it's ready.

## How do I contribute?

Stay tuned.
